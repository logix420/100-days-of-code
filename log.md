# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 19, 2025 Getting over tutorial hell

### Day 1: May 20, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Decided to learn coding via a scripting project. -Python Scripting Project-

**Thoughts:** After trying to find projects to learn, I chose to follow this scripting project to start.

### Day 2: May 21, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Paths of directies which contain files that are what this project is automating in the scripting

**Thoughts:** As it proceeds with the various objects the scripting is including, the project dives right in as I am using the code to interact with the computer as a programmer.

### Day 3: May 22, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Although the lines written seem to flow, syntax is correct and no errors are present, when running the code the paths of the directories are not listed as I prompted.

**Thoughts:** After correcting typos, tried to rewrite the script and looking over each line to ensure it flows. No errors are given, the lines of functions written are followed by loops which seem logical. I have tried some researching, for now it is best to step away and come back again to retry this step.

### Day 4: May 23, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: No further progress made

**Thoughts:** Reviewed the full code with nothing seeming to need correction. Tried to tinker with local file but that too produced no change.

### Day 5: May 24, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Deleted previous clone and restarted project.

**Thoughts:** On this go-around, I will create a new file to code rather than attempting to use the cloned file.

### Day 6: May 25, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Created a new file in the project. 

**Thoughts:** Several attempts with the cloned file results in the same error, yet the error does not prompted when coded from my new file. Not to stay with the same project having no results, I will pause revisiting it later in the next 94 days.

### Day 7: May 26, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Began a 5 project, miniproject. 

**Thoughts:** After reading FreeCodeCamp's Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark article. Which made me to think that in focusing on the long term goal of teaching myself to code, I sought another means to ensure that coding at minimum 30 minutes a day at least. The quiz game coded was finished in 15 minutes and I used tools such as .lower() string method to convert input and also I used assignment operator += to help keep track of the score as well as to give the score total, I used the str((score/4) +  100)+ "%.")

### Day 8: May 27, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Continuing the miniprojects from yesterday. Keeping up with that momentum of improving my coding skills, I next made a guess that number game.

**Thoughts:** In the coding of this project, I used the import module to generate random numbers. The using isdigit() string method to ensure that input was on a number and then gave a range of numbers for which the user to guess. The code prints a suggestion to figure out the random number in a few attempts as possible. 

### Day 9: May 28, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Another one of the miniprojects. Daily improvements to my coding skills. This project coded a game of rock, paper, scissors between the user and computer.

**Thoughts:** Also using the import module to generate random numbers, the project helped me to create code using a list, where rock = 0, paper = 1, scissors = 2. Then storing this list into a variable, the rules for which the user won was entered as if statements and elif, then an else statement to define the alternative making the computer the winner. Similar to scoring using the previous assignment operator +=, this game used it as well and when the game was quit by the user, the number of times the winner (whether it was the computer or user) was printed.
***Extra:*** The code was written correctly yet the input other than q for quit was the only accepted response. I used copilot and asked what was wrong, to which it even responded the code and syntax was correct, but did further support the issue. I was given the insight that there maybe trailing or leading white space. The .strip() string was recommended and also a debugging line. -print("debug: you entered'{user_input}' ")-   This helps you see exactly what the program received from the user, which is useful for troubleshooting input issues.  

### Day 10: May 29, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Today was not able to whip out my laptop to code, instead I used my mobile IDE and daily emailed quiz lines of code.

**Thoughts:** Instead of a few minutes to create a complete app, the time spent was practing the reverse string methods.

### Day 11: May 30, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the miniproject, I coded a choose your own adventure story game.

**Thoughts:** Using the if/elif/else statements, several choses coded could lead the user down various different paths in the game, therefore really allowing their own story to be created.

### Day 12: May 31, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Coded a palidrome checker via the daily email lessons.

**Thoughts:** Took the time to practice function and string methods more by researching Python documentation of Palidromes. Using Copilot, I asked for the steps to writing the boolen false statement after writing my boolen true statement.  Further sought the support of Copilot as the answer for one string was coming back false yet should be true.  I was guided to find out how to add .join to my function therefore to normalize and filter non-alphanumeric characters.

I will add to these self-taught coding files I am creating by challenging myself to find other ways to also solve the coding challenge.

### Day 13: June 1, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Using the tools available, I have prompted Copilot. With it's guidance, I started a notion journal to better equip myself for success to organize notes and created Firefox bookmarks that are designed for as a self-taught developer.

**Thoughts:** Similar to this goal via 100 days of code, I need to document the journey and automate bookmarks to open tools. Additionally spinning up VM's to be my playground

### Day 14: June 2, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Practice coding; problem emailed on Vaccuum Cleaner Route  Given a string representing the sequence of moves a robot vacuum makes, return whether or not it will return to its original position

**Thoughts:** Break down the problem into steps or subproblems. Return to further brain-storm

### Day 15: June 3, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Spun up Unbuntum VM
**Thoughts:** Goal: Practice environment

### Day 16: June 4, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Solved online coding challenges
**Thoughts:** Using brillant.org, I practiced breaking down problems into subproblems and identifying the problem as a step-by-step breakdown.

### Day 17 June 5, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Fininshed Ubuntu VM setup
**Thoughts:** System up and running; ready to use tools for diving in and develop projects

### Day 18 June 6, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Solved online coding challenges
**Thoughts:** I further used brillant.org, I continued with breaking down problems into subproblems and identifying the problem as a step-by-step breakdown to find a solution.

### Day 19 June 7, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Solved Vaccuum Cleaner Route String Problem
**Thoughts:** Engaged with Copilot to help breakdown the problem and finding the solution(s).

### Day 20 June 8, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Python basics lessons begun
**Thoughts:** Beginning to to shift my brain into the mindset of writing code that requires us to think critically, logically, and in a step-by-step manner. 

## Day 21 June 9, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Python basics projects
**Thoughts:**  Just several programs to put into practice of the lessons 

## Day 22 June 10, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Python basics Control Flow
**Thoughts:**  Began the understsnding of Control with if-statements and how these changes allow the floe of writing code to programs.

## Day 23 June 11, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Python basics Control Flow Continued 
**Thoughts:**  Picked up from if-statements to include loops into the control flow topic. 

## Day 24 June 12, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Today spent the available time using the Brilliant App and began to read a FreeCodeCamp article about problem-solving skills and improving analytics. 
**Thoughts:**  The Brilliant App is useful 
for code problems that engage problem-solving and analytic of writing code. The article offers in-depth guidance on the skills of analytical problem-solving. Additionally, it contains a rock, paper, scissor game tutorial with 5 different code basis from recursion to object oriented programming.
