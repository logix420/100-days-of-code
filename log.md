# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 19, 2025 Getting over tutorial hell

### Day 1: May 20, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Decided to learn coding via a scripting project. -Python Scripting Project-

**Thoughts:** After trying to find projects to learn, I chose to follow this scripting project to start.

### Day 2: May 21, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Paths of directies which contain files that are what this project is automating in the scripting

**Thoughts:** As it proceeds with the various objects the scripting is including, the project dives right in as I am using the code to interact with the computer as a programmer.

### Day 3: May 22, 2025 100 Days here we go!
**Today's Progress**: Although the lines written seem to flow, sentex is correct and no errors are present, when running the code the paths of the directories are not listed as I prompted.

**Thoughts:** After correcting typos, tried to rewrite the script and looking over each line to ensure it flows. No errors are given, the lines of functions written are followed by loops which seem logical. I have tried some researching, for now it is best to step away and come back again to retry this step.
