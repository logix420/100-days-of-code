# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Logic Wizard]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 20, Tuesday, 2025].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a project which parses, compiles, and rewrites files to understand what the power of scripting does in Python Coding. Worked on defining functions and then loops/if statements

### R1D2
Using OS paths, the sequence to the scripting requires to seek the files with game to be parsed, and the path which the directory of each has been the goal to move forward with this project.

### R1D3
Troubleshooting paths of directories and scripting intended prompts, spent this day seeking errors in lines of code and/or steps not in place to execute desired code.

### R1D4
Same as yesterday, no success with directory path.

### R1D5
I've deleted the file and will retry the project from scratch.

### R1D6
Began to code from scratch, however the commands are giving errors to the code cloned and the new file response is nothing. After trying to next attempt an Anaconda environment code with Python, I kept receiving the same error which stated path not found. Used copilot to help. Still same error prompt.

### R1D6
Reading through VS Code documentation, tried to further troubleshoot errors and then I downloaded Anaconda. Using get Copilot, tried to correct path issues to use Anaconda with VS Code.

### R1D7
New project began and I created code for a quiz game. 

### R1D8
Miniproject coded a number guessing game

### R1D9
Miniproject rock, paper, scissors coded

### R1D10
Restless kiddos so little time to code via laptop. Instead via a daily emailed practice code.

### R1D11
Within the miniproject build, I coded a create your own adventure game.

### R1D12
Practiced more of string and function basics via coding a palidrome checker

### R1D13
Prompted Copilot to guide me for tools to succeed in my self-taught journey

### R1De14
Practice coding; problem emailed on Vaccuum Cleaner Route

### R1D15
Spun up Unbuntum VM

### R1D16
Problem solving skills practice

### R1D17
String problem solving, breakdown to solution

## R1D18
Lesson in Python basics

## R1D19
Projects in Python basics and further lessons

## R1D20
Control flow

## R1D21
Control flow continued
