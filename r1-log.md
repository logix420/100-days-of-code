# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Logic Wizard]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 20, Tuesday, 2025].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a project which parses, compiles, and rewrites files to understand what the power of scripting does in Python Coding. Worked on defining functions and then loops/if statements

### R1D2
Using OS paths, the sequence to the scripting requires to seek the files with game to be parsed, and the path which the directory of each has been the goal to move forward with this project.

### R1D3
Troubleshooting paths of directories and scripting intended prompts, spent this day seeking errors in lines of code and/or steps not in place to execute desired code.

### R1D4
Same as yesterday, no success with directory path
